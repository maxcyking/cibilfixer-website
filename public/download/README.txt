APK Download Directory
=====================

Place your mobile app files in this directory:

1. Android APK: 
   - Filename: android-app.apk
   - Place your Android APK file here with this exact name

2. iOS App:
   - For iOS, you can either:
     a) Link to App Store URL (update the href in registration-success/page.tsx)
     b) Place TestFlight link or IPA file here

Note: Make sure to update the download links in the registration-success page if you use different filenames or URLs.
